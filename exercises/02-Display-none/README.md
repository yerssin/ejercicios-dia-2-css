# `02` Display None

## 📝 Instructions

1. Hide the first `<h2>` element, but keep the space that it uses (use visibility rule for that).
2. Now hide the second `<h2>` but this time use display:none; to also release the area/space that it was using (the bottom content should move up).
3. Make the all the `<li>` elements of #myUL to display inline.
4. Make strong elements display as block elements (that will turn them into boxes).

Expected result:
