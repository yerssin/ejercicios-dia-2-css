# `08` Split Screen in Three

## 📝 Instructions

Use `display: flex` again but now to divide the website in 3 vertical columns with the same size.

## 💡 Hint

1. Have the three boxes render in the same line.
2. Use 33% as your width for each, that way you make sure that the three of them occupy 1/3 of the screen. 

> Important: The closing tag of any of the 3 sections needs to be right next to the opening tag of the next sibling section; if not, the browser will add a small separation between the two divs.
