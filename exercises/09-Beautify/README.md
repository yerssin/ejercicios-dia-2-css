# `09` beautify

This is a real life example sponsored by one of our students; in this case, he was trying to make his website look like this:

![beautify](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/layouts-exercises/blob/master/.learn/assets/GxuRWC7.png?raw=true)

Right now, some of the divs don't show, others show in a different way, etc.

## üìù Instructions

The problem here is some missing opening and closing tags, some CSS selectors are duplicated and some divs have the same #id. Fix the code and make it look how it was supposed to look.
