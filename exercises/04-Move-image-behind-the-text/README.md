# `04` Move the image behind the text

`Z-index` is similar to the "Bring To Front" feature of MS PowerPoint:

![Z-index](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/layouts-exercises/blob/master/.learn/assets/f4hm3qp.png?raw=true)

Elements with a bigger z-index are more up front than elements with lower z-index.

## 📝 Instructions

Use the z-index rule to send the image to the back.

Expected result:

![04-Move-image-behind-the-text](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-layouts-tutorial-exercises/blob/master/.learn/assets/z-index.png?raw=true)
