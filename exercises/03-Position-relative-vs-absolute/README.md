# `03` Position Relative vs Absolute

This is very important:

First, run the exercise, you will see both `<div>` tags acting like default boxes.

1. Apply the class `.absolutePositionExample` to `#secondDiv` and compare results.
2. Remove that class, and now apply `.relativePositionExample` to `#secondDiv` and compare results.

Ask yourself:

### What was the difference? 

The relative position is relative to the beginning position of the element, the absolute ignores the beginning position completely.
