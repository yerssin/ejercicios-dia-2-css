# `09.2` Calendar Icon

In this case, we are using the `::before` and `::after` elements to try to recreate a calendar icon like this one:

## 📝 Instructions

1. Please move the ::before and ::after elements of the .calendar element in the proper way so they can be placed just like the picture.
2. Please move the ::before and ::after of the `<em>` element in the proper way so they can be placed just like the picture.
3. Change their colors as well so they can have the same color, and apply the border-radius to the `::before` and `::after` of the `<em>` to make them look like a ring in 2 dimensions seen from the front.

## 💡 Hint: 

If you don't make them position: absolute, they will continue occupying the original area/space they were occupying.
